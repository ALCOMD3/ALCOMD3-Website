# ALCOMD3 MCP Guide

This document describes ALCOMD3 MCP setup, available tools, lifecycle behavior,
and troubleshooting.

ALCOMD3 implements stdio transport for MCP specification `2025-11-25`. An MCP
client starts `alcomd3-mcp` as a child process and exchanges JSON-RPC messages
through stdin/stdout. `alcomd3-mcp` then requests application data through the
local IPC endpoint exposed by the ALCOMD3 GUI.

## Quick Start

1. Start ALCOMD3 and open the MCP page from the sidebar.
2. Enable MCP.
3. Copy the Bridge Command shown on the page.
4. Add it as a stdio MCP server in your MCP-capable client.
5. Run a tool call while MCP remains enabled in ALCOMD3.

Use the command shown by the GUI instead of guessing the bridge path. See
[Enabling MCP and Client Configuration](#enabling-mcp-and-client-configuration)
for a configuration example and lifecycle details.

## Current Boundaries

- MCP is disabled by default. Users must enable it in the GUI before new tool
  calls may read or write ALCOMD3 data.
- When the GUI is running normally, it starts the local IPC endpoint. Enabling
  or disabling MCP gates tool data access; it does not stop the endpoint.
- Current tools include read-only project, repository, package, environment,
  activity log, and technical log tools, plus limited write tools: create a
  project, add an existing project, add a VPM repository, back up a registered
  project, copy a registered project, restore a project from a zip backup, and
  install/uninstall/reinstall one package in a registered project. Other write
  operations such as repository deletion, repository reorder, and project
  deletion are not exposed.
- `initialize` and `tools/list` do not start the GUI.
- When a real tool call needs the GUI and the endpoint is missing or
  unreachable, the bridge attempts to start the GUI, waits for the endpoint,
  and retries once.
- If GUI startup fails or the endpoint remains unavailable, the tool call
  returns structured `alcomd3_unavailable` and marks the MCP tool result with
  `isError: true`.
- When MCP is disabled, new tool calls return structured `mcp_disabled`, do not
  stop the endpoint, do not panic, and mark the MCP tool result with
  `isError: true`. Existing project long tasks are cleanup exceptions:
  `tasks/get`, `tasks/result`, and `tasks/cancel` may still query or cancel the
  task.
- The bridge applies loose local rate limiting and concurrency protection to
  tool calls. When the limits are exceeded, it returns structured
  `rate_limited` and marks the MCP tool result with `isError: true`.
- The GUI MCP page highlights known tool calls while they run, and briefly keeps
  the highlight after completion or failure so fast calls remain visible.
- The GUI MCP page groups tools by read-only, write, and log usage, and keeps
  the exact MCP names. Hovering over a tool name shows the localized readable
  name.
- The GUI MCP page shows recently active clients, not a live connection list.
  Records with no recent activity are hidden automatically.
- MCP tool calls are written to the GUI's local activity log. Records include
  source, tool name, request id, client summary, started/completed/failed/cancelled
  state, and safely processed target/details so users can review what an Agent
  did from the GUI Activity page.
- The GUI project management page and MCP package tools share the backend
  GUI-visible package catalog. Pre-release filtering, yanked packages, hidden
  repositories, hidden local user packages, same-name package merge across
  sources, default/user repository priority, and Unity compatibility are all
  handled by the shared backend.
- Every public MCP tool must map to an existing GUI capability and enter
  business logic through shared backend services under `vrc-get-gui/src/backend/`.
  MCP dispatch is responsible only for enabled-state gating, argument parsing,
  task wrapping, error mapping, and activity logging; it should not add business
  capabilities the GUI does not have.
- stdio stdout contains only MCP JSON-RPC messages; logs must go to stderr.
- The GUI internal IPC listens only on `127.0.0.1`; it never listens on a public
  network address.

Activity records do not save raw MCP params, token-like fields, HTTP header
values, URLs with query strings, or URL userinfo credentials. Local filesystem
paths keep their full value for diagnosing Unity, VPM, and non-ASCII path
issues; MCP access still requires enabling MCP in the GUI first.

## Architecture

```text
MCP Host / Client
        |
        | stdio JSON-RPC
        v
alcomd3-mcp
        |
        | reads endpoint metadata
        v
ALCOMD3 data dir / mcp / endpoint.json
        |
        | localhost TCP, newline-delimited JSON
        v
ALCOMD3 GUI IPC server
```

The external MCP transport is stdio. The GUI internal TCP IPC is a private
channel between the bridge and the desktop app; it is not an HTTP or MCP
transport exposed directly to MCP clients.

## Enabling MCP and Client Configuration

1. Start ALCOMD3.
2. Open the MCP page from the sidebar.
3. Enable MCP to allow tools to read ALCOMD3 data.
4. Copy the Bridge Command from the page.
5. In a client that supports stdio MCP servers, add an MCP server whose command
   uses the copied `alcomd3-mcp` path.

A generic configuration shape is shown below. Exact field names depend on the
MCP client:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "alcomd3": {
            "command": "C:\\Path\\To\\ALCOMD3\\alcomd3-mcp.exe"
        }
    }
}
```

On macOS and Linux, use `alcomd3-mcp` without the `.exe` suffix. Prefer the
command shown on the GUI MCP page.

After configuration, the MCP client may keep the `alcomd3-mcp` stdio connection
while ALCOMD3 is not running. On the first real tool call, the bridge attempts
to start the ALCOMD3 GUI. After the GUI starts and exposes the endpoint, calls
return data if MCP is enabled in the GUI. If MCP is disabled, new tool calls
return `mcp_disabled`; the user can enable MCP in the GUI and retry. Already
started project long tasks can still be queried or cancelled through task
follow-up methods.

## Package Locations

- Windows: `alcomd3-mcp.exe` is installed next to the main GUI executable.
- macOS: `alcomd3-mcp` is under `.app/Contents/MacOS/`.
- Linux: `alcomd3-mcp` is installed to `/usr/bin/alcomd3-mcp`.
- AppImage: `alcomd3-mcp` is inside AppDir `usr/bin/`.

`cargo xtask build-alcom` builds both the GUI main program and `alcomd3-mcp`.

## Endpoint Metadata

When the GUI is running normally, it writes endpoint metadata. The default path
is under the ALCOMD3 local data directory:

```text
ALCOMD3/mcp/endpoint.json
```

Tests and development can override the path with:

```text
ALCOMD3_MCP_ENDPOINT_FILE
```

Tests and development can also override the GUI executable the bridge starts:

```text
ALCOMD3_GUI_EXECUTABLE
```

Metadata format:

```json
{
    "protocolVersion": 2,
    "transport": "tcp",
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 49152,
    "token": "opaque-random-token",
    "pid": 12345
}
```

`token` is used only for local IPC authentication between the bridge and GUI.
Do not expose the endpoint file to remote systems.

## Internal IPC

Internal IPC uses newline-delimited JSON. Request and response shapes:

```text
IpcRequest {
    protocolVersion,
    token,
    requestId,
    client,
    method,
    params
}

IpcResponse {
    requestId,
    ok,
    result?,
    error?
}
```

The GUI validates `protocolVersion` and `token`. Validation failures return a
business error and do not run tool logic. After validation, if MCP is disabled
in the GUI, the GUI returns `mcp_disabled` for new tool data access and task
startup, and does not read or return project, repository, package, or similar
data. Existing project long-task methods `project_task_get`,
`project_task_list`, and `project_task_cancel` are exceptions so clients can
finish querying or cancelling already running tasks after MCP is disabled.

## Available Tools

All tools return JSON. Success responses include `ok: true`; business failures
include `ok: false` and `error: { code, message, data? }`, and the outer MCP
tool result includes `isError: true`.

| Tool | Arguments | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `alcomd3_list_projects` | `{}` | Lists projects registered in ALCOMD3. |
| `alcomd3_get_project_details` | `{ "project_path": string }` | Gets details and installed package summary for a registered project. `project_path` must match a project registered in ALCOMD3. |
| `alcomd3_list_repositories` | `{}` | Lists current remote repositories and display settings. `repositories` includes official defaults, Curated defaults, and user repositories; `userRepositories` remains as a user-repository-only compatibility field. |
| `alcomd3_add_repository` | `{ "repository_url": string, "headers"?: object }` | Downloads and validates a VPM repository URL, adds it as a user repository, and clears package cache so later loads refresh. Success returns the added `repository` summary; activity logs store only a redacted URL and header count, not header values. |
| `alcomd3_get_package_details` | `{ "package_name": string, "version"?: string, "repository_id"?: string, "repository_url"?: string }` | Gets detailed metadata for a GUI-visible package. `package_name` is required; `version` and repository selection fields can narrow the result to one version or source. |
| `alcomd3_list_packages` | `{ "offset"?: number, "limit"?: number }` | Paginates lightweight summaries of GUI-default-visible packages. Within one source, each package name returns only the latest visible version, with `source.kind` set to `officialDefault`, `curatedDefault`, `userRepository`, or `localUser`. MCP does not server-side search; clients or Agents should filter returned rows. |
| `alcomd3_list_repository_packages` | `{ "repository_id"?: string, "repository_url"?: string, "offset"?: number, "limit"?: number }` | Paginates lightweight GUI-visible package summaries for one repository. Within that repository, each package name returns only the latest visible version. Call `alcomd3_list_repositories` first to get `id` or `url`, then pass one of those fields. |
| `alcomd3_get_environment_settings` | `{}` | Reads an environment settings summary, including added Unity installs, default Unity launch arguments, default project path, and backup path. |
| `alcomd3_search_activity_logs` | `{ "search"?: string, "sources"?: string[], "kinds"?: string[], "statuses"?: string[], "visibility"?: "important" \| "primary" \| "secondary" \| "technical" \| "all", "operations"?: string[], "tool_names"?: string[], "request_id"?: string, "target"?: string, "since"?: string, "until"?: string, "offset"?: number, "limit"?: number, "order"?: "newest" \| "oldest" }` | Paginates user-readable activity log summaries. By default it returns only important activity; `limit` defaults to 50 and maxes at 200. |
| `alcomd3_get_activity_log_entry` | `{ "id": string, "include_details"?: boolean }` | Reads one full activity log entry by id. Details do not include raw MCP params, URL query, or URL userinfo; local paths remain complete for diagnostics. |
| `alcomd3_summarize_activity_logs` | `alcomd3_search_activity_logs` arguments plus `{ "group_by"?: "source" \| "kind" \| "status" \| "operation" \| "tool_name" \| "client_name" \| "day" \| "hour" }` | Aggregates activity records by source, kind, status, operation, tool, client, or time to locate records before reading them. |
| `alcomd3_get_activity_log_context` | `{ "id": string, "before"?: number, "after"?: number, "include_details"?: boolean }` | Reads neighboring activity around an entry for operation-chain review; `before`/`after` max at 50. |
| `alcomd3_search_technical_logs` | `{ "search"?: string, "levels"?: string[], "targets"?: string[], "scope"?: "memory" \| "recent_files", "since"?: string, "until"?: string, "offset"?: number, "limit"?: number, "max_message_chars"?: number }` | Paginates technical log previews. Defaults to current process memory `error`/`warn`, `limit` defaults to 50 and maxes at 100, and message previews default to 300 characters. |
| `alcomd3_get_technical_log_entry` | `{ "id": string, "max_message_chars"?: number }` | Reads one technical log message by id; the message is redacted and capped at 4000 characters. |
| `alcomd3_summarize_technical_logs` | `alcomd3_search_technical_logs` arguments plus `{ "group_by"?: "level" \| "target" \| "file" \| "hour" }` | Aggregates technical logs by level, target, file, or hour to locate error hotspots. |
| `alcomd3_create_project` | `{ "project_name": string, "base_path"?: string, "template_id"?: string, "unity_version"?: string }` | Creates a Unity project, resolves project packages, and registers it in ALCOMD3. `project_name` is required; omitted `base_path` uses the GUI default project path; omitted `template_id` and `unity_version` use the current GUI template selection rules. Success returns `projectPath`, `templateId`, and `unityVersion`. |
| `alcomd3_add_existing_project` | `{ "project_path": string }` | Registers an existing Unity project directory in ALCOMD3. `project_path` must be an absolute path and load as a valid Unity project. Success returns `projectPath`. |
| `alcomd3_backup_project` | `{ "project_path": string, "backup_name"?: string, "exclude_vpm_packages"?: boolean }` | Creates a zip backup for a registered project using the current GUI backup directory and backup format. `exclude_vpm_packages` omits installed VPM package contents when `true` and defaults to `false`. Omitted `backup_name` generates the project-name-plus-timestamp default; a provided name overrides the archive file name without `.zip`. Success returns `backupPath`. |
| `alcomd3_copy_project` | `{ "source_project_path": string, "new_project_path": string }` | Copies a registered project to a new non-existing directory and registers the copied project. Success returns `projectPath`. |
| `alcomd3_restore_project_from_backup` | `{ "backup_path": string, "project_name"?: string }` | Restores a project from a zip backup into the GUI-configured default project directory and registers it. If `project_name` is omitted, the backup file name is used. Success returns `projectPath`. |
| `alcomd3_install_project_package` | `{ "project_path": string, "package_name": string, "version_selector": { "type": "latest_gui_visible" } \| { "type": "exact", "version": string }, "source"?: { "repository_id"?: string, "repository_url"?: string }, "allow_conflicts"?: boolean }` | Installs one GUI-visible package compatible with the project's Unity version into a registered project. `latest_gui_visible` uses the same visible package, source priority, and pre-release settings as the GUI backend; `exact` must still match a GUI-visible version. Conflicts or legacy file/folder deletion block by default. |
| `alcomd3_uninstall_project_package` | `{ "project_path": string, "package_name": string, "allow_conflicts"?: boolean }` | Uninstalls one installed package from a registered project. Conflicts or legacy file/folder deletion block by default. |
| `alcomd3_reinstall_project_package` | `{ "project_path": string, "package_name": string, "allow_conflicts"?: boolean }` | Reinstalls one installed package in a registered project. Conflicts or legacy file/folder deletion block by default. |

### Log Query Tools

Log tools are split into activity records and technical logs so an Agent does
not need to pull all logs into context to diagnose one issue.

- Activity records are user-readable, structured, and redacted operation
  history. `alcomd3_search_activity_logs` defaults `visibility` to `important`,
  returning writes, failures, cancellations, and important MCP/System behavior.
  Pass `secondary`, `technical`, or `all` explicitly when needed.
- Activity search results return summary fields only, including id, time,
  source, kind, status, operation, target, duration, and error summary. Call
  `alcomd3_get_activity_log_entry` for details or
  `alcomd3_get_activity_log_context` for surrounding activity.
- Technical logs are for diagnostics. By default they search current process
  memory for `error` and `warn`. Pass `"scope": "recent_files"` for recent
  files, or explicit `levels` for Info/Debug/Trace.
- Technical log tools do not return unlimited raw text. Search returns
  `messagePreview`; details are truncated by `max_message_chars` and redact
  token, secret, authorization, API key, `sk-` values, URL userinfo, query, and
  fragment.
- Log tools are themselves recorded as MCP read activity. Successful log reads
  are Secondary; failures remain visible as failed activity.

### Project Long Tasks

Tasks were introduced in MCP `2025-11-25` and are currently experimental.
Client support varies, and their protocol behavior may evolve in future MCP
versions.

`alcomd3_create_project`, `alcomd3_backup_project`, `alcomd3_copy_project`,
`alcomd3_restore_project_from_backup`, `alcomd3_install_project_package`,
`alcomd3_uninstall_project_package`, and `alcomd3_reinstall_project_package`
support MCP task-aware calls and declare `execution.taskSupport: "optional"` in
`tools/list`.

Clients that support Tasks can include `task: {}` in `tools/call` params:

- `tools/call` immediately returns a `CreateTaskResult` containing
  `task.taskId`.
- `tasks/get` queries `working`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`, and similar
  states.
- `tasks/result` returns the original tool result shape after completion, such
  as `backupPath`, `projectPath`, or package-change summary.
- The tool result returned by `tasks/result` includes
  `_meta.io.modelcontextprotocol/related-task` with the matching `taskId`.
- `tasks/cancel` cancels the underlying GUI backend task and releases the
  project task lock of that type.
- If `alcomd3_create_project` is cancelled before formal registration, or if
  package resolve/apply fails, it cleans up the unregistered project directory
  created by MCP.
- If the user disables MCP while a task is running, new tool calls and new
  project task starts still return `mcp_disabled`; long tasks that already have
  a `taskId` can still be finished with `tasks/get`, `tasks/result`, and
  `tasks/cancel`.

If `_meta.progressToken` exists on `tools/call`, the bridge sends standard
`notifications/progress`. `tasks/get` `_meta` also includes
`alcomd3/projectProgress` for polling the latest progress snapshot:

```json
{
  "_meta": {
    "alcomd3/projectProgress": {
      "total": 120,
      "proceed": 42,
      "lastProceed": "Assets/example.prefab"
    }
  }
}
```

Without task-aware calls, these tools still run as normal synchronous
`tools/call` calls until they complete.

### Path Restrictions

`alcomd3_get_project_details`, `alcomd3_backup_project`,
`alcomd3_copy_project`, and project package install/uninstall/reinstall tools
only accept source project paths that are registered in the ALCOMD3 database.
MCP clients cannot use these tools to read or copy arbitrary local paths.

`alcomd3_get_environment_settings` returns ALCOMD3-saved local paths, such as
Unity executables, default project directory, and backup directory. It does not
start Unity, ask Unity Hub to refresh, or scan additional disks.

`alcomd3_backup_project` `backup_name` must be one legal file name, not a path,
and must omit the `.zip` extension, which is appended automatically. The archive
is always written to the GUI-configured backup directory, and an existing
archive is never overwritten.

`alcomd3_copy_project` `new_project_path` must be an absolute, non-existing
directory path and must not be inside the source project. The tool creates the
directory, copies project files, registers the new project, and cleans up the
new directory on failure. `alcomd3_restore_project_from_backup` `backup_path`
must be absolute and restores only into the GUI-configured default project
directory. `project_name` must be one legal folder name, not a path separator,
root path, or `..`. `alcomd3_create_project` applies the same single-folder-name
restriction to `project_name`; explicit `base_path` must be absolute. Omitted
`base_path` uses the GUI default project path. `alcomd3_add_existing_project`
`project_path` must be absolute and load as a Unity project.

### Package Visibility and Write Limits

`alcomd3_list_packages` and `alcomd3_list_repository_packages` use the same
package-state load path as the GUI package page, not the force-refresh path.
Results follow GUI pre-release, hidden repository, hidden local user package,
and yanked filters. MCP tool calls do not server-side search. Adding a
repository requires an explicit `alcomd3_add_repository` call; list tools never
implicitly add repositories or redesign repository refresh behavior.

The GUI project-management package table is generated by the backend from
same-name package merge logic. MCP package lists, package details, and project
package install selection use the same backend rules:

- When "Show pre-release packages" is off, GUI and MCP GUI-visible results do
  not include pre-release versions; MCP `latest_gui_visible` cannot select
  pre-release versions either. The underlying cache may still store
  pre-release data; it becomes visible only after the setting is enabled again.
- Yanked packages do not enter visible candidates. If the installed package
  version is currently yanked, the project package row keeps the yanked marker.
- Hidden repositories and hidden local user packages affect only visible
  candidates. Hidden sources may still appear as "existing source" information,
  but do not participate in latest-version selection.
- Same-name packages across sources are merged into one row on the project
  management page. Default repositories, local user packages, user
  repositories, and unregistered repositories are merged in backend order.
- Project package installation selects only GUI-visible candidates compatible
  with the project's Unity version.

`alcomd3_install_project_package`, `alcomd3_uninstall_project_package`, and
`alcomd3_reinstall_project_package` first generate pending project changes. If
the result contains dependency conflicts or legacy file/folder deletion and
`"allow_conflicts": true` was not passed, the tool returns
`project_package_conflicts` with change summary in `error.data.changes`; nothing
is applied to the project. Confirm and retry with `"allow_conflicts": true` to
continue apply.

Package list tools return only discovery-friendly summary fields: `name`,
`displayName`, `version`, and `source`. `totalCount` and paging fields are
computed from aggregated summary rows, not raw repository version lists. To
read description, keywords, dependencies, legacy packages, documentation URL,
changelog URL, or Unity version requirements, choose a candidate from the list
and call `alcomd3_get_package_details`.

Package list tools default `offset` to `0` and `limit` to `200`; `limit` maxes
at `1000`. Paging responses include `totalCount`, `offset`, `limit`,
`returnedCount`, `hasMore`, and `nextOffset`. To read a complete list, keep
requesting `nextOffset` while `hasMore` is `true`. Package tools no longer
return a `count` field.

## Lifecycle and Multi-Process Behavior

`alcomd3-mcp` is normally started by an MCP client as a stdio server. Different
clients or client sessions may start multiple bridge processes; that is a
normal result of MCP client management.

ALCOMD3 lifecycle boundaries:

- When the GUI exits, it stops the IPC listener and deletes the endpoint file.
- `alcomd3-mcp` does not exit automatically when the GUI exits. It keeps the MCP
  stdio connection so AI agents such as Codex can recover calls after the GUI
  restarts without restarting the client.
- The GUI can observe internal IPC requests from the bridge, but cannot
  reliably know whether the MCP client and bridge stdio session is still alive.
  Therefore the GUI client area shows recent activity; tool highlight indicates
  a currently handled call.
- When the GUI is unavailable, tool calls return structured
  `alcomd3_unavailable`.
- When the GUI is available but MCP is disabled, new tool calls return
  structured `mcp_disabled`; task follow-up methods for already started project
  long tasks can still query results or cancel tasks.
- After the GUI restarts, new endpoint metadata is written to the same path and
  later tool calls reconnect to the GUI. Whether data is returned depends on
  whether MCP is enabled in the GUI.
- If a tool call happens while the GUI is not running, the bridge attempts to
  start the GUI. To avoid popping the GUI when an MCP client merely loads
  configuration, `initialize` and `tools/list` do not trigger startup.

If you see several `alcomd3-mcp.exe` processes briefly:

1. Check whether multiple MCP clients or multiple client sessions are running.
2. A bridge still running after the GUI closes is not necessarily stale; as long
   as the MCP client keeps the stdio connection, it continues running so calls
   can recover after GUI restart.
3. If the MCP client is definitely closed but the bridge remains, it is usually
   an old bridge version or a client that did not manage stdio lifecycle
   correctly. Close the corresponding MCP client or end the old process before
   testing with the new version.

## Errors and Troubleshooting

### `mcp_disabled`

The MCP page is disabled. The endpoint may still show as running; this is
normal. Enable MCP and retry the tool. Already started project long tasks are
exceptions: clients may still use `tasks/get`, `tasks/result`, and
`tasks/cancel` to query or cancel them.

### `rate_limited`

The bridge received too many tool calls in a short period, or too many tool
calls are already running. Retry later.

### `ALCOMD3 is not running or the MCP IPC endpoint is unavailable`

Common causes:

- ALCOMD3 GUI is not running.
- The endpoint file is missing, expired, or deleted.
- The client started `alcomd3-mcp` from an old path.

Steps:

1. Start ALCOMD3.
2. Confirm endpoint running on the MCP page.
3. Copy the Bridge Command again and update the MCP client configuration.
4. Restart the MCP client.

### `protocol mismatch`

The bridge and GUI internal IPC versions do not match. This usually means the
client started an old `alcomd3-mcp`. Copy the command shown on the GUI MCP page
again and confirm it points to the current install directory.

### Non-JSON Content on stdout

This is a bug. A stdio MCP server stdout must contain only JSON-RPC. Debug
output must go to stderr.

## Development Smoke Test

Build the bridge from the repository root:

```powershell
cargo build -p alcomd3-mcp
```

With the GUI stopped, a missing endpoint can verify that the bridge does not
panic:

```powershell
$env:ALCOMD3_MCP_ENDPOINT_FILE = Join-Path $env:TEMP "missing-alcomd3-mcp-endpoint.json"
$payload = @'
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-11-25","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"smoke","version":"0.0.0"}}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"notifications/initialized"}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/list","params":{}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"alcomd3_list_projects","arguments":{}}}
'@
$payload | .\target\debug\alcomd3-mcp.exe
```

Expected result:

- `initialize` succeeds.
- `tools/list` returns the current MCP tools.
- `tools/call` returns a readable `ok: false` error and marks the MCP tool
  result with `isError: true`.
- stdout contains no non-JSON-RPC logs.
